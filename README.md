# Power-BI-All-in-One-Exercice
This Power BI exercise was completed as part of my PL-300 certification and covers most of the core functionalities of Power BI Desktop.
The raw dataset is included so you can explore or build your own analysis.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions—I’ll be happy to help.
